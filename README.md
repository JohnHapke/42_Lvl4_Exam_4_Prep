## Purpose
> This repository serves as a preparation hub for the 42 Exam Rank 4. The goal is to practice and master the types of problems that might appear in the exam by coding the exercises and challenges in C. These exercises focus on improving problem-solving skills, understanding of C programming concepts, and time management under exam-like conditions.
